 * ============================================================================
 * OVERVIEW
 * This plugin is a form of "stat distribution"- an alternative to the standard
 * of leveling up to raise an actor's stats.
 *
 * Integrates with others of mine plugins:
 * - J-DropsControl; enables usage of item-as-panel drops.
 * - J-ABS; enemies will individually drop their points and panels.
 * - J-ABS-Speed; enables usage of Movespeed Boost as a parameter on panels.
 * - J-CriticalFactors; enables usage of CDM/CDR as parameters on panels.
 * - J-Proficiency; enables usage of Proficiency+ as a parameter on panels.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * DETAILS:
 * This system allows the player's party to unlock "stat distribution panels"
 * (aka SDPs), by means of plugin command.
 *
 * The scene to manage unlocked SDPs is accessible via the menu, the JABS
 * quick menu, or via plugin command.
 *
 * Each SDP has the following:
 * - 1+ parameters (of the 27 available in RMMZ) with flat/percent growth.
 * - A fixed rank max.
 * - A relatively customizable formula to determine cost to rank up.
 * - Customizable name/icon/description1/description2.
 * - Rank up rewards for any/every/max rank, which can be most anything.
 *
 * In order to rank up these SDPs, you'll need to use SDP points. These can be
 * acquired by using the tags below, or by using plugin commands.
 *
 * NOTES:
 * - SDP points gained from enemies are earned for all members of the party.
 * - SDP points are stored and spent on a per-actor basis.
 * - SDP points for an actor cannot be reduced below 0.
 * - Stat Distribution Panels are unlocked for all members of the party.
 * - Stat Distribution Panel rewards can unlock other panels.
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTE:
 * The SDP data is derived from an external file rather than the plugin's
 * parameters. This file lives in the "/data" directory of your project, and
 * is called "config.sdp.json". You can absolutely generate/modify this file
 * by hand, but you'll probably want to visit my github and swipe the
 * rmmz-data-editor project I've built that provides a convenient GUI for
 * generating and modifying SDPs in just about every way you could need.
 *
 * If this configuration file is missing, the game will not run.
 *
 * Additionally, due to the way RMMZ base code is designed, by loading external
 * files for configuration like this, a project made with this plugin will
 * simply crash when attempting to load in a web context with an error akin to:
 *    "ReferenceError require is not defined"
 * This error is a result of attempting to leverage nodejs's "require" loader
 * to load the "fs" (file system) library to then load the plugin's config
 * file. Normally a web deployed game will alternatively use "forage" instead
 * to handle things that need to be read or saved, but because the config file
 * is just that- a file sitting in the /data directory rather than loaded into
 * forage storage- it becomes unaccessible.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * NOTE ABOUT PANEL NAMES:
 * Generally speaking, you can name your chosen panels (described in the
 * configuration file mentioned above) whatever you want- with a couple of
 * exceptions for organizational purposes within the JMZ Data Editor.
 *
 * If a panel starts with any of the following characters:
 * - "__" (double underscore)
 * - "--" (double hyphen/dash)
 * - "==" (double equals)
 * Then the panel will not be included in the list that is parsed from the
 * configuration file upon starting the game.
 * ============================================================================
 * SDP POINTS:
 * Ever want enemies to drop SDP Points? Well now they can! By applying the
 * appropriate tag to the enemy/enemies in question, you can have enemies drop
 * as little or as much as you want them to.
 *
 * TAG USAGE:
 * - Enemies only.
 *
 * TAG FORMAT:
 *  <sdp:POINTS>
 *
 * TAG EXAMPLES:
 *  <sdp:10>
 * The party will gain 10 SDP points from defeating this enemy.
 *
 *  <sdp:123456>
 * The party will gain 123456 SDP points from defeating this enemy.
 * ============================================================================
 * SDP MULTIPLIERS:
 * Ever want allies to gain some percentage amount more (or less) of the SDP
 * points earned from enemies? Well now you can! By applying the appropriate
 * tag to the various database locations applicable, you can gain a percentage
 * bonus/penalty amount of SDP points obtained!
 *
 * NOTE:
 * The format implies that you will be providing whole numbers and not actual
 * multipliers, like 1.3 or something. If multiple tags are present across the
 * various database locations on a single actor, they will stack additively.
 * SDP points cannot be reduced below 0 for an actor, but they most certainly
 * can receive negative amounts if the tags added up like that.
 *
 * TAG USAGE:
 * - Actors
 * - Classes
 * - Skills
 * - Weapons
 * - Armors
 * - States
 *
 * TAG FORMAT:
 *  <sdpMultiplier:AMOUNT>    (for positive)
 *  <sdpMultiplier:-AMOUNT>   (for negative)
 *
 * TAG EXAMPLES:
 *  <sdpMultiplier:25>
 * An actor with something equipped/applied that has the above tag will now
 * gain 25% increased SDP points.
 *
 *  <sdpMultiplier:80>
 *  <sdpMultiplier:-30>
 * An actor with something equipped/applied that has both of the above tags
 * will now gain 50% increased SDP points (80 - 30 = 50).
